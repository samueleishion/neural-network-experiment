Neural Network Experiment
=========================

A visual representation of a simple neural network based on the model described on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron#Spreadsheet_example 

How to run it
-------------
```
python main.py 
```

How to interact
---------------
Several nodes (neurons) will be displayed. The top ones are sensorial, the middle ones are transmitters, and the bottom ones are terminals. You can click on the sensorials to transmit signals. 

You can change some features such as window size of number of sensorial/terminal neurons by editing main.py
